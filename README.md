# WagonTokenized Contract - Audit Preparation

## 📋 Contract Overview

**Contract Name:** WagonTokenized  
**Symbol:** WAGNX  
**Standard:** ERC20 with extensions  
**Upgradeable:** Yes (UUPS pattern)  
**OpenZeppelin Version:** ^5.4.0  

## 🔧 Key Features

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **ERC20 Token** - Standard token functionality
- ✅ **Burnable** - Users can burn their own tokens
- ✅ **Pausable** - Emergency pause functionality
- ✅ **Permit** - Gasless approvals (EIP-2612)
- ✅ **Upgradeable** - UUPS upgrade pattern

### Access Control
- ✅ **Role-based permissions** - Admin, Pauser, Minter, Blacklister, Upgrader
- ✅ **Multi-sig ready** - Each role can be assigned to different addresses

### Blacklist System
- ✅ **Add/Remove blacklist** - Blacklister role can manage blacklist
- ✅ **Transfer restrictions** - Blacklisted addresses cannot send tokens
- ✅ **Destroy blacklisted funds** - Blacklister can destroy tokens from blacklisted addresses
- ✅ **Total supply reduction** - Destroyed tokens reduce total supply

## 🔒 Security Features

### Access Control
```solidity
bytes32 public constant PAUSER_ROLE = keccak256("PAUSER_ROLE");
bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");
bytes32 public constant BLACKLISTER_ROLE = keccak256("BLACKLISTER_ROLE");
bytes32 public constant UPGRADER_ROLE = keccak256("UPGRADER_ROLE");
```

### Blacklist Protection
- Senders cannot transfer if blacklisted
- Burning from blacklisted addresses is allowed (for destroyBlackFunds)

### Upgrade Safety
- Only UPGRADER_ROLE can authorize upgrades
- UUPS pattern ensures upgrade authorization

## 🧪 Test Coverage

**Total Tests:** 14/14 passing ✅

### Test Categories
- **Deployment** - Role assignments and initialization
- **Blacklist Functionality** - Add/remove/check blacklist
- **Token Transfers** - Normal and restricted transfers
- **Minting** - Role-based minting
- **Upgrade Authorization** - Role-based upgrades

## ⚠️ Security Considerations for Audit

### 1. Centralization Risks
- **Admin powers** - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE has significant control
- **Blacklister powers** - Can destroy any blacklisted funds
- **Upgrader powers** - Can upgrade contract logic

### 2. Blacklist Edge Cases
- **Recipient blacklist check** - Prevents receiving tokens when blacklisted
- **Burning from blacklisted** - Allowed for destroyBlackFunds function
- **Event emissions** - All blacklist operations emit events

### 3. Upgrade Considerations
- **Storage layout** - Must be preserved during upgrades
- **Initialization** - Constructor properly disables initializers
- **Authorization** - Only UPGRADER_ROLE can upgrade

## 🔍 Audit Focus Areas

### Critical Functions
1. **`destroyBlackFunds`** - Destroys tokens from blacklisted addresses
2. **`_update`** - Core transfer logic with blacklist checks
3. **`initialize`** - Contract initialization and role setup
4. **`_authorizeUpgrade`** - Upgrade authorization

### Security Patterns
- **Reentrancy protection** - No external calls in critical functions
- **Access control** - Role-based permissions throughout
- **Event logging** - All state changes emit events
- **Input validation** - Proper checks for all parameters

## 📊 Gas Optimization

### Function Gas Costs
- `addToBlacklist`: ~52,727 gas
- `destroyBlackFunds`: ~38,216 gas
- `mint`: 46,214 - 80,414 gas
- `removeFromBlacklist`: ~30,849 gas
- `transfer`: ~61,132 gas

### Deployment Cost
- **Total deployment**: ~2,275,896 gas (7.6% of block limit)

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Verify all role assignments
- [ ] Test upgrade functionality
- [ ] Validate blacklist operations
- [ ] Confirm event emissions

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Verify contract addresses
- [ ] Test all role functions
- [ ] Validate token operations
- [ ] Monitor for events

## 📝 Audit Recommendations

### For Auditors
1. **Focus on access control** - Verify role-based permissions
2. **Review blacklist logic** - Ensure proper restrictions
3. **Check upgrade safety** - Validate UUPS implementation
4. **Test edge cases** - Blacklist + transfer combinations
5. **Verify event emissions** - All state changes logged

### Known Limitations
- **Centralized control** - Admin has significant powers
- **Blacklist dependency** - Relies on trusted blacklister role
- **Upgrade risk** - Upgrader can change contract logic
